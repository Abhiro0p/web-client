  /* 
    Custom font family for PDF export, as this does not support the build-in font families and needs to be imported separately 
    Supporting both internal and external ttf
    
    Internal fonts need to be placed as ttf in 'app/components/fonts/' without special chars and white spaces
    Working example for file "Comic_Sans_internal.ttf":
      --custom-font-file: "Comic_Sans_internal.ttf";
    
    External fonts can be imported by full url
    Working example:
      --custom-font-file: "https://some.url.com/ext/Comic_Sans_internal.ttf";

    NOTE: The url needs to point to an existing ttf file. Font-builders like google fonts e.g. are not supported
